### Project Goals
The goal of this prototype is to provide a proof of concept for a resource that helps ageing adults self-assess their frailty risk. This tool aims to inform users if a risk is identified. It demonstrates the potential for incorporating such assessments into a broader health monitoring application.

### User Goals
The site targets ageing adults and healthcare professionals. User goals are:

- To assess frailty risk using validated tools
- To receive a clear and concise risk stratification
- To understand which areas of physical well-being may need extra support
- To easily navigate and use the assessment tools

The site effectively meets these goals because:
- It offers three validated assessments: PRISMA 7 Questionnaire, Gait Speed Test, and TUG Test
- It provides an overall risk stratification based on the assessments completed
- It is user-friendly with clear instructions for each assessment
- The design is responsive and easy to navigate
